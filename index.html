Definition: A network is a collection of interconnected nodes or devices that communicate with each other to share resources, information, or services.

Types of Networks:

LAN (Local Area Network): Limited geographical area like a home, office, or school.
WAN (Wide Area Network): Spans large distances, often connecting LANs across cities or countries.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Covers a city or a large campus area.
Wireless Networks: Use radio waves or infrared signals for communication, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Internet: A global network of networks, connecting billions of devices worldwide.
Network Components:

Nodes: Devices like computers, routers, switches, servers, and printers.
Links: Physical connections like Ethernet cables or wireless connections.
Network Devices: Hardware like routers, switches, and hubs that facilitate communication between nodes.
Protocols: Rules and conventions governing communication between devices, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.
Network Topologies:

Star: All nodes are connected to a central hub or switch.
Bus: Nodes are connected in a linear fashion, sharing a single communication line.
Ring: Nodes are connected in a circular configuration, with each node connecting to exactly two other nodes.
Mesh: Each node is connected to every other node, providing redundancy and multiple paths for data.
Network Services:

File Sharing: Sharing files and resources across a network.
Email: Electronic mail communication between users.
Web Hosting: Hosting websites and web applications on servers accessible via the internet.
Remote Access: Accessing resources or systems from a remote location over a network.
Network Security:

Firewalls: Protecting networks by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.
Encryption: Securing data transmission by encoding it to prevent unauthorized access.
Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or devices before granting access to resources.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity or threats.
Emerging Technologies:

5G: Next-generation mobile network technology offering faster speeds and lower latency.
Internet of Things (IoT): Interconnected network of devices embedded with sensors and software for data exchange.
Software-Defined Networking (SDN): Centralized control of network infrastructure through software, enabling automation and programmability.
